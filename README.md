# What I Learned While Building This Project
# 1. Line Chart Implementation
I wasnâ€™t familiar with creating line charts initially, but with the help of YouTube tutorials and AI tools, I was able to implement it easily. This was a great learning experience, and now I feel confident working with charts in my projects.

# 2. Storing Multiple Data Entries into the Database
At first, I was unsure how to handle large datasets and insert them into the database efficiently. Previously, I only added data manually through the admin interface or frontend forms. However, I learned a new approach: using a few lines of code to bulk-insert JSON data directly into the database. This method is not only efficient but also saves a lot of time when dealing with massive datasets.
